Provide the email address for the user you'd like to invite, and set the user's **Access Role**.

Click **Add +** for additional rows if you would like to send out more than one invitation.

When done, click **Send Invites** to proceed. ShiftLeft will send invitation emails to the users you indicated with instructions on how to set up their new accounts and access the ShiftLeft Dashboard.

### Resending Invitations

You can resend an invitation to create a ShiftLeft account to users at any time. To do so:

1. Go to **User** > **User Management**
2. Find the user for whom you want an invitation resent
3. Click the **Resend** link available next to the user's **Status**
