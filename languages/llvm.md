LLVM is a compiler infrastructure project providing a set of compiler and toolchain technologies, which can be used to develop a front end for any programming language and a back end for any instruction set architecture.

After [installing the ShiftLeft Command Line Interface (CLI)](../using-cli/install-cli.md) and [authenticating](../using-cli/authenticating.md), use this command to run ShiftLeft Ocular

```scala
sl ocular
```
