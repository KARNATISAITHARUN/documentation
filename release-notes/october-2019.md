# ShiftLeft October 2019 Updates

**[Ability to Group Applications in the ShiftLeft Dashboard](../using-inspect-protect/using-dashboard/view-results.md#grouping-application-results)**. Application groups are useful for viewing vulnerabilities across multiple associated microservices in a single Dashboard view. Each microservice is still analyzed individually, and vulnerabilities are identified by individual microservice.

**Improved ShiftLeft Documentation**. ShiftLeft documentation has been expanded and improved on the following topics:

* [Policies](https://docs.shiftleft.io/shiftleft/shiftleft-policies)
* [Generating and Working with Security Profiles](../using-ocular/getting-started/generate-sp.md)
* [Querying the CPG and Security Profiles](../using-ocular/getting-started/query-cpg.md)
