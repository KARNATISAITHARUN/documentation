# Wildfly Configuration

Make sure you've [installed the ShiftLeft CLI](../../../using-cli/install-cli.md) on the WildFly server, and that you have access to the [shiftleft.json file](../json-file.md) for the specific application target (JAR, WAR, or EAR file) you've deployed - this file was created when you ran ShiftLeft Inspect against the target.  Also please make sure that the $HOME and $JBOSS_HOME environment variables are properly set.

The simplest way to proceed is to modify standalone.sh (or standalone.conf if present):

1. Add a call to 'sl update java-agent' to ensure that the latest version of the ShiftLeft Java microagent library is present in $HOME/.shiftleft

2. export SHIFTLEFT_CONFIG=(complete path to the shiftleft.json file)

3. Add the -javaagent flag to JAVA_OPTS. Point the flag to the location of the current ShiftLeft microagent jarfile e.g. "-javaagent:$HOME/.shiftleft/sl-microagent-latest.jar". **Note: there is an interaction between the ShiftLeft agent and WildFly's logging configuration, so please note the following code sample carefully:
**

```bash
SL_OPTS=-javaagent:$HOME/.shiftleft/sl-microagent-latest.jar

export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xbootclasspath/p:$JBOSS_HOME/modules/system/layers/base/org/jboss/logmanager/main/jboss-logmanager-2.0.4.Final.jar -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager $SL_OPTS"
```

Make sure you back up standalone.conf or standalone.sh before you proceed.
