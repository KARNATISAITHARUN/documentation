# Analyzing Applications using ShiftLeft Inspect

Use the `sl analyze` command to submit applications to ShiftLeft Inspect for code analysis and security profiling.

If you are using ShiftLeft Inspect with [ShiftLeft Protect](../../introduction/products.md), you can analyze your code before running your application, for example to integrate with a build / Continuous Integration (CI) environment. To do so, you must integrate the  [ShiftLeft JSON file](../protect/json-file.md) into your runtime environment and make it available to the ShiftLeft Protect Microagent. This allows the Microagent to be associated with your application.

## Analysis Workflow

1. Review the [ShiftLeft Inspect requirements](../../introduction/requirements.md).
2. [Install the ShiftLeft Command Line Interface (CLI)](../using-cli/install-cli.md) on the host where you will submit applications for analysis.
3. Successfully build the application using a supported build tool (maven, gradle, sbt) **before** you submit the application for analysis using ShiftLeft Inspect. 
4. Submit the application for analysis using one of the supported analysis commands (see below).
5. For each code commit, rebuild the application and resubmit it for analysis by integrating the CLI with an CI/CD build system to automate analysis: [Jenkins](../integrating-with-shiftleft/integrating-jenkins-builds/integrating-jenkins-builds.md), [GoCD](../integrating-with-shiftleft/integrating-gocd-builds.md), [Bamboo](../integrating-with-shiftleft/integrating-bamboo-builds.md), [TeamCity](../integrating-with-shiftleft/integrating-teamcity-builds.md), [Travis](../integrating-with-shiftleft/integrating-travis-builds.md), CircleCI.

## Analysis Commands

The ShiftLeft CLI supports two modes of analysis. The mode you choose depends on your business requirements.

### sl analyze --app <name> [<path>] 

Use `sl analyze --app <name> <path>` to upload the application to the ShiftLeft cloud for analysis. This mode of analysis is suitable for most use cases.

The flag `--app <name>` tells ShiftLeft to associate the analysis with the application `<name>`. This allows different analysis requests (for different versions of the same application) to be associated in the ShiftLeft UI.

The `sl analyze` command scans the artifact (JAR/WAR) provided by `<path>`.

### sl analyze --app <name> --cpg [<path>]

Use `sl analyze --app <name> --cpg <path>` to submit security metadata for proprietary application code (in lieu of bytecode), and bytecode for open source dependencies. 

Using `--cpg` mode is appropriate if you prefer to generate security metadata locally for proprietary code before submitting it to ShiftLeft for analysis. **Note**: The use of the --cpg flag consumes more memory on your build machine. Please ensure that you have at least 16GB RAM available on your build machine if you plan to use this flag.
