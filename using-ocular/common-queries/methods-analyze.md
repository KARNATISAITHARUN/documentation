# Investigating Methods

This example explains using ShiftLeft Ocular to examine methods. It uses [HelloShiftLeft](../../introduction/helloshiftleft.md) to illustrate the steps and results.

ShiftLeft Ocular examines your application using methods directly in the code, by helping you navigate to exposed methods. The analysis can be mixed with parameters, method annotations and types, to perform more powerful Code Property Graph (CPG) queries. For example, it is possible to navigate to the specific function in the code that accepts data from a publicly exposed Web API endpoint. In modern applications, Java annotations are used to link a given endpoint URI to a function that handles user provided data through the endpoint URI (for example, in the Spring Framework, @GetMapping, @PostMapping and @PathVariable are used). 

## List HTTP Endpoint Handler Methods

The query returns a list (`l`) of the methods having a parameter annotated as PathVariable; those methods have no parent callers (which makes them user-controlled API endpoint handlers).

```
ocular> cpg.annotation.name(".*PathVariable.*").parameter.method.filterNot(_.callIn).name.l
res20: List[String] = List(
  "updateCustomer",
  "getLedger",
  "withdrawFromAccount",
  "addInterestToAccount",
  "removeCustomer",
  "getRssForCategorySafe",
  "getRssForCategoryUnsafe",
  "getCustomer",
  "getAccount",
  "depositIntoAccount"
)
```

## List All Methods Filtered by a String in their Name

The query lists (`l`) all the methods containing the `Controller` string in their full name.

```
ocular> cpg.method.fullName(".*Controller.*").name.l
res24: List[String] = List(
  "updateCustomer",
  "init",
  "handleGeneralError",
  "getLedger",
  "<init>",
  "<clinit>",
  "<init>",
  "withdrawFromAccount",
  "addInterestToAccount",
  "<clinit>",
  "getAccountList",
  "index",
  "saveSettings",
  "removeCustomer",
  "doGetLogin",
.. )
```
