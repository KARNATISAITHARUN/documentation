# How to Identify Inspect Results Using Branch Names

You can include branch names in the code analysis results produced by Inspect. This allows you to ensure that results generated from automated analysis of your branches remain independent of one another.

To include branch in formation in the results generated by Inspect:

1. Obtain the branch name from your version control system. For example, Git allows you to do this using `git rev-parse --addrev-ref HEAD1.

2. Add the branch name you obtained in the previous step to the script you use to automate the running of Inspect using the `--tag` option (i.e., `sl analyze --tag branch=<branchname>`

At this point, ShiftLeft will include the branch name when [displaying results](../using-dashboard/view-results.md#displaying-results-by-branch-name) from your code analyses in the Dashboard.
