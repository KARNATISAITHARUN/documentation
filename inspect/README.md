# Inspect

Inspect is a static application security testing (SAST) solution...

Inspect can be installed and run on machines with Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. Before you run your first code analysis, however, you'll need to [install and authenticate](/inspect/getting-started/getting-started.md) with ShiftLeft.

## Next Steps

1. Please see the language-specific guides for using Inspect to [analyze your application code](/inspect/analyzing-applications/analyzing-applications.md).

2. You can [integrate Inspect](inspect/integrations/integrations.md) with the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools of your choice.

3. If you are working with multiple applications (or multiple branches of one application), learn how to configure Inspect to [differentiate between each branch](/inspect/integrations/branch-names.md).

4. Learn how to [fail builds](/inspect/integrations/failing-builds.md) based on the results from Inspect's code analyses.
