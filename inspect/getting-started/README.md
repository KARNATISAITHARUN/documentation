# Getting Started

Inspect can be installed and run on machines with Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. Before you run your first code analysis, however, you'll need to install and authenticate with ShiftLeft:

* Instructions for [Linux/macOS users](/inspect/getting-started/linux-macos.md)
* Instructions for [Windows users](/inspect/getting-started/windows.md)

***If you've already completed the Quickstart, you can skip this step and go straight to [Analyzing Applications](../analyzing-applications/README.md).***
