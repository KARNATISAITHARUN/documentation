# What is ShiftLeft?

**ShiftLeft** is a next-gen code analysis platform purpose built for developers. 

ShiftLeft's proprietary **Code Property Graph (CPG)** depicts your application's control flow, program dependencies, and abstract syntax trees as a single data structure, enabling you to understand fundamentally what each version of you app does and find any scenarios that may pose risks.

The Code Property Graph (CPG) also allows ShiftLeft to perform code analyses up to **40 times faster** and **3 times more** accurately than legacy static analysis tools.

## Getting Started

Learn the basics of ShiftLeft with the Quickstarts for **[Linux/macOS](/quickstarts/linux-macos.md)** and **[Windows](/quickstarts/windows.md)**.
